## **Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**

This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship** and focuses on customer segmentation using **K-Means clustering**. The goal is to categorize customers based on their purchase behavior, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies and improve customer experience.

## **Dataset**

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: **Customer Purchasing Behaviors** and includes features such as:

- **Annual Income**
- **Purchase Amount**
- **Loyalty Score**
- **Purchase Frequency**

You can download the dataset from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hanaksoy/customer-purchasing-behaviors).

## **Key Features**

- **K-Means Clustering**: Implemented to group customers into clusters based on similar characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and cleaning the dataset.
- **Cluster Visualization**: Visualized the clusters and marked the **centroids** to understand the center of each group.

## **Cluster Interpretations**

After applying **K-Means clustering**, we obtained three distinct clusters:

- **Cluster 0**: Represents low-income customers who also have low spending habits and loyalty scores.
- **Cluster 1**: Indicates high-income customers who are more loyal and spend more frequently.
- **Cluster 2**: Represents a balanced group that does not strongly lean towards high or low spending.

The **Silhouette Score** for the clustering was **0.56**, indicating a **moderately well-defined clustering structure**.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **K-Means** is an effective method for grouping customers with similar characteristics.
- Visualizing the clusters and their centroids helps to understand customer behavior patterns.
- The analysis can be used for **customer segmentation** in marketing, allowing for more personalized campaigns.
